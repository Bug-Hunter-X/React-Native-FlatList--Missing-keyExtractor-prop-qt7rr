In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an uncommon error can occur if you forget to include the `keyExtractor` prop.  The `keyExtractor` prop is crucial for efficient rendering and data management.  Without it, React Native will issue a warning or possibly crash if your data changes, because it needs a unique key to identify and update each item effectively. For example:
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <MyComponent item={item} />}
/>
```
This code will likely cause problems.  The correct way is to use a `keyExtractor` function which returns a unique string ID for each item in your data array.  Consider this example:
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <MyComponent item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```
Here, we use the `id` property of each item as the unique key.  If your data doesn't have an `id` you'll need to add one or use a different unique identifier, such as an index. Using index as key can be problematic if the order of items changes. A better approach might be generating UUIDs.
